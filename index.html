<h3>SWTOR 4.0 PVE/PVP Powertech/Vanguard Tanking guide</h3>
<h4>What does it mean to tank?</h4>
<p>When it comes to playing as the team tank, you should ALWAYS start the fights whether it be against adds, mobs of enemies, and bossfights, its the tank's role to ALWAYS the fights. As a tank, you act as the guardian of the raid team, taking the hard hits and protecting the team from excessive damage.</p1>
<h4>Vanguard or Powertech?</h4>
<p>A big misconception when it comes to picking factions and sub classes in SWTOR is the difference in each class as a playstyle, in reality all classes are mirrored to provide a solid playstyle between factions. Essentially, a Powertech and Vanguard are exactly the same class, except with differences with story and abilities. (names and animations are very different)</p2>

<h4>Rotations</h4>
<p>When it comes to starting fights, tanks generally follow a cycle of abilites (a rotation) to help maintain a high amount of threat and damage when against an enemy. Folllowing a rotation as a tank generally allows you to increase your mitigation towards damage, thus increasing your survivability mid battle.<p3>
<p>In order to start a fight successfully stack mitigation and threat, the following guide has been created.<p4>
<h4>Powertech:</h4>
<p>SC(Preload)--->Grapple--->JC--->RP--->FB or FS (x2)--->FStorm--->HB--->SC--->ES--->RP--->SC--->ND or SM--->ED--->RS--->FB or FS (x2)--->FStorm--->HB--->Death From Above--->RINSE AND REPEAT
