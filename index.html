<h3>SWTOR 4.0 PVE/PVP Powertech/Vanguard Tanking guide</h3>
<h4>What does it mean to tank?</h4>
<p>When it comes to playing as the team tank, you should ALWAYS start the fights whether it be against adds, mobs of enemies, and bossfights, its the tank's role to ALWAYS the fights. As a tank, you act as the guardian of the raid team, taking the hard hits and protecting the team from excessive damage.</p1>
<h4>Vanguard or Powertech?</h4>
<p>A big misconception when it comes to picking factions and sub classes in SWTOR is the difference in each class as a playstyle, in reality all classes are mirrored to provide a solid playstyle between factions. Essentially, a Powertech and Vanguard are exactly the same class, except with differences with story and abilities. (names and animations are very different)</p2>
<h4>PVE and PVP</h4>
<p>Playing against the environment (PVE) as a tank, mitigation to damage is generally favored over stacking endurance/health. In PVE your best bet when it comes to tanking is the balance of mitigation and endurance, having your stats fully rely on mitigation doesnt give much leverage to certain down times when you get stunned/incapacitated and unable to cast your defensive cooldowns/abilities, putting more stress onto your group healer and having to rely on more than yourself to take down certain enemies.</p3>
<p> When playing against other players (PVP) as a tank, a big misconception is the utility of having mitigation. In PVP, mitigation is a useless stat because in PVP matches other players can bypass your defensive stats with simple auto critical hits when casting abilities or simply using basic attacks. When playing as a tank in PVP you best bet at staying alive is stacking endurance/health with DPS (Damage Per Second) capabilities. When playing against other players, being the team guardian isn't a very viable tactic as players can switch targets and ignore other players, unlike the AI which depends on aggro/threat to focus on one target. Given this, simply stacking defensive stats doesn't work, so if you were to play as a tank in PVP with these tactics, you'd be an easy kill on the warzone, so having DPS capability allows you to substitute as a tank/dps class.</p4>
<h4>What stats should I prioritize?</h4>
<p>As mentioned before, the stats you prioritize depend on which mode/environment you play in. In PVP the best way to tank is to stack Endurance/health. In a PVE scenario its best to have a balance between Shield, Absorb, and Defense between Endurance.</p>
<h4>PVE and PVP stat tiers</h4>

<h4>Rotations</h4>
<p>When it comes to starting fights, tanks generally follow a cycle of abilites (a rotation) to help maintain a high amount of threat and damage when against an enemy. Folllowing a rotation as a tank generally allows you to increase your mitigation towards damage, thus increasing your survivability mid battle.<p3>
<p>In order to start a fight successfully stack mitigation and threat, the following guide has been created.<p4>
<h4>Powertech Rotation:</h4>
<p>SC(Preload)--->Grapple--->JC--->RP--->FB or FS (x2)--->FStorm--->HB--->SC--->ES--->RP--->SC--->ND or SM--->ED--->RS--->FB or FS (x2)--->FStorm--->HB--->DFA--->RINSE AND REPEAT
<h4>Vanguard Rotation:</h4>
<p>GC(Preload)--->Harpoon--->Storm--->SS--->IP or ES (x2)--->IStorm--->EB--->GC--->ES--->SS--->GC--->NJ or SM--->SD--->HIB--->IP or ES(x2)--->IStorm--->EB--->MV---->RINSE AND REPEAT
