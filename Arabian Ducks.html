  <h3>Advice for More Advanced Tanks</h3>
<p>This next piece of advice is for tanks who are interested in running ops with a consistent group. Get to know your co-tank. Know their strengths and weaknesses. Know what they will be doing before they do it. This takes a lot of time, but it is a great bond to have. There may come a time when you two are unable to communicate verbally and you will have to trust that your co-tank will do exactly what needs to be done.</p>
<p> Until this level of bond is created, however, talk to your co-tank as much as possible. You do not necessarily have to tell one another every time each of you taunt (feel free to do so if needed), but tell one another when it is time to perform a tank swap or pick up a newly spawned enemy. Always let your co-tank know what is going on in case they do not see it. The most common statement that should always be communicated is “I am out of taunts/cooldowns, please taunt the boss.” Taking NiM Brontes as an example, tanks need to taunt and run into orbs. An easy way to communicate which orb you are about to taunt is to put a target marker* (like fire) on the orb and say “I am going to take fire, ignore it.” That way, your co-tank can spend his or her time paying attention to other mechanics rather than focusing on that one orb.</p>
<p>An effective way to do this mid-combat is to keybind several target markers (Preferences -> Key Bindings -> Targeting). I use F for fire and Shift + F for lightning. One skill that many tanks overlook is being able to offtank. This is the time when you are not in the spotlight of the boss’s Target of Target icon. Some tanks seem to get anxious when this happens and taunt the boss.</p>
<p>The results can vary from the former main tank being mildly annoyed to the new main tank quickly dying due to not respecting mechanics that require a tank swap. If you ever feel bad about not having your energy regenerate as quickly or not being in the spotlight, just remember you are still essential to the group. If the main tank does die, you have to be ready to taunt a split second later and continue the fight like nothing happened while the DPS or healers combat rez the fallen tank. Tanking is a team job and when you offtank, your co-tank still needs you to be alert and ready in case something goes horribly wrong. If possible, record yourself or watch recordings from other people’s videos with you tanking. Figure out what you did right/wrong and what to do next time. Figure out why you died each time, whether it is due to poor cooldown use, ranging healers, taking spike damage, etc. Additionally, watch other people tank content on Twitch or YouTube. See what their strengths and weaknesses are and learn from them. There were no mechanics added to [in fact, some mechanics were removed from] the boss fights in 4.0, so older videos are still relevant (although the health stats may not be). The handful of exceptions to this include HM Revan and HM Master/Blaster. The former’s fight was repeatedly changed during 3.X and Hydraulic Overrides were given a longer cooldown timer in 4.0, which prevents people from being able to ignore every “pull in” on the third floor.
