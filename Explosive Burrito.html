  <h4> The Basics to clearing Operations/Raids</h4>
  <p>One common mistake for tanking is having tunnel vision. Whether it comes from focusing too hard on quickbars or the boss’s health, it has to stop. Situational awareness is the key to tanking; you should be scanning the room at all times, looking for something that may wipe the group. Having your camera able to zoom out all the way is a must (Preferences -> Controls -> Camera).This way, you can always be on the lookout for ways to mitigate damage to the raid (and sometimes yourself). Also turn on Target of Target (located in the Interface Editor). This tiny, but important icon will tell you at what your target is looking, e.g., who the boss is attacking. Other than some special circumstances, you or your co-tank should always be the boss’s target.</p>
  <p>If that is not the case, you or your co-tank should immediately taunt. I also have my group’s health bars large enough so that I can keep an eye on them to see when the healers are stressed (and thus should use a personal cooldown or raid cooldown) or if people are suddenly taking lots of damage (suggesting they have aggro on something or a mechanic is not being followed properly). While on the topic of taunting, let’s discuss threat. Everyone generates threat by healing, doing damage, or taunting. The person with the most threat is the person the boss will target and start attacking. Often times in the beginning of fights, DPS will perform several high damaging moves. These high damaging moves will generate a lot of threat on the boss, possibly causing the tanks to lose the boss’s attention. To avoid this situation, the DPS can use their threat dump before their threat becomes too high (but after the tank taunts the boss as part of their normal rotation), tanks can guard DPS who have high threat, or tanks can perform the triple taunt rotation. Guards should almost always be on DPS, not healers. In PVE content, whoever is being guarded will receive a 5% damage reduction and a 25% reduction in threat generated. The small amount of damage reduction will not make or break groups, but the decrease in threat generated will. (Having a high burst class pull the boss during the fight will lead to sudden burst damage on the group, which can lead to many deaths.) Thus primarily use your guard on DPS. (The only time I do not is for the final phase of NiM Brontes since a healer being stunned by the boss’s Fire and Forget is detrimental. This attack is based on aggro, so I still use the guard for its threat reduction rather than its damage reduction.) The triple taunt rotation is as follows: perform 2-3 high threat attacks on the target, single target taunt during the GCD, and continue attacking the target while watching the taunt debuff on the target’s bar. When the debuff is about to wear off, use your AOE taunt and continue attacking. Once the AOE taunt is about to wear off, perform the single target taunt again. This will give you a massive amount of threat which makes it almost impossible for DPS to steal threat. Never open a fight with a taunt since taunts multiply threat on the boss. At the beginning of the fight, everyone has zero threat, which means your taunt will be wasted. Additionally, feel free to continue taunting the boss through the fight (if your taunt does not need to be saved for a tank swap mechanic). Due to the 4-piece tanking set bonus introduced in 3.0, single target and AOE taunts actually have much shorter cooldowns than 15 seconds and 45 seconds respectively. How short depends on how many times you are able to use the attack.</p>
  <p>When maintaining threat on a group of adds, you should constantly be switching who you are attacking. AOE attacks, while initially useful to generate threat on all the adds in the group, will not be able to maintain enough threat for the entire fight. Thus, tanks need to perform their single target rotation on the adds, while occasionally using an AOE ability to maintain threat on the group. A few attacks (two to five, depending on how many adds are in the group) should be performed on each enemy before switching targets. This method will help ensure the tanks have the highest threat on every target. If this fails, use your taunts. Due to how quickly taunts cooldown thanks to the 4-piece set bonus, tanks should never be afraid that they are wasting a taunt by using it to get an enemy back from a DPS. To practice tanking mobs, queue for flashpoints. The only person the adds should be targeting is you as you are the only tank in the group. If target of target has anyone else’s icon, you should immediately taunt. For extra practice, run the flashpoint with some friends or guildmates and instruct them to pull mobs in succession as quickly as possible. This will teach you how to get threat on a target when you were not prepared. (Although not ideal, having a DPS pull an enemy before the tank will happen and tanks need to know what to do in those situations to prevent as many deaths as possible.)</p>
